Stake.com Bonus Code Claimer Chrome Extension

Developed by Ardag7, the Stake.com Bonus Code Claimer Chrome Extension is an indispensable tool for online casino enthusiasts. Here's why:

Real-time Bonus Code Access: The extension connects directly to Ardag7's Code Server, ensuring users have immediate access to all the latest Stake.com Bonus Codes. With three programs running 24/7, codes are collected from 10 different sources, guaranteeing users get codes as soon as they're released.

Auto-Claiming Functionality: Users can opt to automatically claim monthly, weekly, and forum challenge bonuses from Stake.com. Once enabled, the extension handles the claiming process seamlessly, saving users time and effort.

Reload Claim Automation: The extension features a reload claim section where users can automate their reload claims. By simply checking a checkbox, users activate the reload claiming functionality. The extension intelligently understands the reload interval, displaying the next claim time and automatically claiming reloads when due.

Free Trial and Subscription Option: To allow users to experience the benefits firsthand, a one-week free trial of the Bonus Code claims service is available. For continued access, users can subscribe to the service for a monthly fee.

No Registration or Payment Required for Reload Claims: Unlike the Bonus Code claims service, users can enjoy the reload claim functionality without any registration or payment. It's completely free to use.

We value your feedback and welcome any suggestions or comments you may have to further improve the extension. Feel free to reach out on this platform with your thoughts!
